This is a test example for the number search code 1

Unfortunately, I cannot write in numbers 55 what the final total would be 90909 because that would get added in as well

So here my friends 989 is the final answer in numbers -9->  one + fifty-five + ninety thousand nine oh nine + nine hundred eighty nine + nine = 

nine,one,nine,six,three

As your final answer
this code worked in table format too.
